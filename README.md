# The Saga of PLS

The main motivating trigger behind this book has been my long standing obsession 
to understand the historical development of Partial Least Squares methods.
Who created PLS? When was it developed? How was the development process? 
And why? How does something such as PLS is developed? What were the circumstances 
that gave birth to that framework? In this sense, the quest became a quest not 
only about PLS itself but also about its creator, about his mind, his ideas, 
and surrounding context.

This book can be used as a companion reading for any course, workshop, or 
seminar about PLS methods, expecting to be enjoyed by anyone interested on this 
topic.
