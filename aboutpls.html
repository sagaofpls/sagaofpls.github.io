<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> A little bit about Partial Least Squares</h1>
<p>One of the ever present tasks of almost every data analysis endeavor is the
study of relationships between variables. In its simplest form, the analyst wants
to know whether two values are related with one another. For instance, I might
be interested in studying if there is a relation between the number of calories
in the coffees my friends and I drink, and the price we pay for them. The question
about the relation between calories and price can be further broken down in other
inquiries: What is the nature of the potential relationship? What is its
magnitude? Or how important is it? I could also expand the analysis and ask about
a possible dependency: Can I predict the prices of coffees based on the number
of calories they contain? Or viceversa: Knowing the price of a coffee, what can
I say about its number of calories? To answer these questions we can turn to the
rich set of analytical tools that statistical methods give us by using a number
of graphical displays and charts, measures of simultaneous variation such as
covariance, coefficients of association such as correlation, and modeling options
such as regression analysis.</p>
<p>Often, we don’t have just two variables but many more. If we were hired to do a
deeper and broader analysis on data from coffee shops, we surely would have more
available information like the area size of the establishments, or records about
frequent customers. Hence we could ask about the relationship between the number
of square meters and the cost of the coffees. Furthermore, we can think about the
differet aspects that go into the preparation of a cup of coffee—the beans,
water, milk, sugar, etc—and how they may be associated with the financial
performance of the businesses (earnings, losses, costs, etc). These questions
and many others arise naturally when we do data analysis, and we aim to tackle
them at various levels of statistical complexity.</p>
<p>Depending on the circumstances, we may face situations in which the analyzed data
are divided—or can be divided—into sets of variables. With the hypothetical
coffee shops data, one set of variables may be comprised by quantity of
ingredients (beans, water, milk, sugar), a second set may be formed by utilities
consumption (gas, electricity, water, internet, etc), and a third set may be
composed of sales by size of container (sold units by size: small, medium, large).
Sometimes we just care about describing and summarizing the relationships. This
is typically done in the initial phase of the analysis when we are in exploratory
mode. Sometimes we may be interested in relationships of prediction and explanatory
nature. Based on the analysts’s preconceived ideas or hypotheses about the data,
more advanced and sophisticated tools can de devised. In all these cases we can
rely on a wide range of multivariate statistical methods that allow us to generalize
the analysis of two variables into two or more sets of variables. Among such
methods, Partial Least Squares techniques stand out as one remarkable toolbox
that, simply put, provides a versatile data modeling platform for analyzing
relations among one or more sets of variables.</p>
<div id="pls" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> PLS</h2>
<p>Rooted in a couple of data model-building and computational ideas developed
by Herman Wold in the 1960s, <strong>Partial Least Squares</strong> methods have traveled a
long journey until reaching the high praise and recognition they receive today.
Experiencing gradual changes, and bifurcating into several branches, PLS methods
have gone through a fascinating—although not always smooth—evolutionary process.
Nevertheless, they all have proven to be tremendously valuable on both theoretical
and practical aspects.</p>
<p>At its heart, Partial Least Squares provide a versatile platform for analyzing
multiple relationships among one or more sets of variables—measured on some
objects. Among their attractiveness we can highlight several features:</p>
<ul>
<li>their deceptively simple iterative mechanisms</li>
<li>their ease of programming implementation</li>
<li>their estimation ideas anchored on the principle of least squares</li>
<li>their marked geometrical flavor of projection-based methods</li>
<li>their inherent dimension reduction nature</li>
<li>their rich possibilities for data visualization</li>
<li>their strong inductive spirit</li>
<li>their fit within statistical learning approaches</li>
</ul>
<p>Above everything else, the most captivating trait—in my opinion—is that
Partial Least Squares offers us a wide analytical platform that covers a large
number of multivariate data analysis techniques. Plus, it gives us the ability
to connect a number of seemingly unrelated methods. Such a platform, encompassing
both its computational side, and its flexible analytical essence, is of a great
richness and applicability very few times encountered in other data analysis
approaches.</p>
<div id="a-broad-definition-of-pls" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> A broad definition of PLS</h3>
<p>If what you are looking for is an official definition of PLS I’m afraid you
won’t find such thing. Instead, we could give different meanings to the PLS term.
From a narrow point of view, we could talk about PLS as an algorithmic template
for computing several multivariate models. From a more applied angle we could
also talk about PLS as a family of regression-type data analysis methods. From
a richer and more comprehensive standpoint, we can regard PLS as an umbrella
term for dealing with multirrelational systems of one or more sets of variables
following the principle of partial least squares. It is the latter description
that I like to consider for defining PLS as a general framework. Here’s my
definition. Broadly speaking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Partial Least Squares is a versatile multivariate
data modeling framework for analyzing multiple relationships
among one or more sets of variables measured on some objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing for sure is that there’s a large number of methods labeled with the
PLS acronym. Such an amazing variety of methods and approaches, so diverse and
plural, makes them seem practically impossible to view under a united scope.
In my opinion, many headaches would be avoided if there was a unique reason for
a method to be labeled with the PLS acronym. For better or worse, there is not
just one but several sources that make a method be sheltered under the PLS brand.
Methods carrying PLS as prefix or suffix are so varied and so imbued in different
fields and areas of application that it seems hard to picture them all under the
same lens.</p>
<p>The literature about PLS methods is incredibly rich. If you take a look at the
dozens of references about Partial Least Squares, you will be shocked with a
mind blowing puzzle. The major benefit of such abundance of material is the r
ichness of concepts, principles, applications, extensions, and new proposals.
The ugly side is that there’s no universal view, no unified notation, no unique
terminology, and even worse, slightly different connotations of the term PLS.
Which only makes it easy to get lost along the way. After all, this reflects the
evolution of PLS methods, how they have spread out, how they have permeated into
different subfields, and how they have come to occupy multiple places within the
collective consciousness of Multivariate Data Analysis. Everywhere a PLS method
has taken up residence, it dresses in different clothes, does its hair differently,
and speaks a slighty different dialect.</p>
<p>In summary, as soon as you take a first step into PLS territory, you can
immediately get disoriented in the middle of the trees without being able to
appreciate the forest in all of its magnitude. No wonder why many practitioners
are confused about exactly what PLS is, what it does, how it works, and how they
can benefit from it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="some-words-of-caution" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Some words of caution</h2>
<p>I would be a fool to tell you that there is one single universal perception of
Partial Least Squares. Depending on who you talk to, you can get different
meanings for the term PLS. If you ask your favorite search engine about “PLS,”
you might get answers like “please,” or “political science,” which is obviously
not what we are talking about. If you search for the term “partial least squares,”
I bet you will find most results related to what is known as <em>PLS Regression</em>—the
most popular version of PLS methods. Not surprisingly, most people think of PLS
as just another technique for solving regression-like problems. This is not a
mere coincidence but the result of the intricated history behind PLS, splattered
with random twists of fate. Now, while it is true that the regression version
may be the most common presentation people know, it is by no means the only one.
For other people, PLS is an approach for estimating what are known as Structural
Equation Models with latent variables.</p>
<div id="path-modelism-and-regressionism" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Path Modelism and Regressionism</h3>
<p>Today we can distinguish two main branches of Partial Least Squares approaches:
1) the <strong>Path Modeling</strong> branch, and 2) the <strong>Regression</strong> branch. The former
introduced by Herman Wold, and the latter headed by Svante Wold. The recognition
of these two large categories has to do with the way in which they have
subsequently unfolded. By taking different directions, the branches have produced
two major <em>movements</em> that for the most part, have grown apart, remained
disconnected, and even unaware of one another in some areas of application.</p>
</div>
<div id="pls-noun-or-adjective" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> PLS: Noun or Adjective?</h3>
<p>The study of Partial Least Squares (PLS) methods begins with potential
confusion—the term “PLS” has become broader and looser over the years.
One problematic area has to do with the way authors use the term PLS. Sometimes
PLS is used as a noun, while others is used as an adjective. As a noun, “PLS”
is not one method but a set of methods. Talking about Partial Least Squares as
a single methodology is like talking about Athletism as a single discipline,
or like talking about the Himalayas as a single mountain. Hence, we should
always let users/readers know that PLS implies a big family of methods.</p>
<p>As an adjective, “PLS” describes the <em>flavor</em> of a given method. Generally,
authors have baptized PLS algorithms after the methodology they sprout from.
In this sense, the acronym PLS is used as a label to indicate the estimation
approach of a given technique. For instance, PLS as used in “PLS Regression”
works as an adjective, describing the estimation procedure for a regression model.</p>
</div>
<div id="algorithmic-approaches" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.3</span> Algorithmic approaches</h3>
<p>Another problem is when we hear or read about “the PLS algorithm.” The truth
is that PLS methods are a bit of an anomaly in that they are both <strong>methodologies</strong>
(with specifications, assumptions, and motivational reasons) and <strong>algorithms</strong>
(with computational and operational aspects). This means that all PLS methods
have their associated algorithm. Often, many different PLS methods are presented
by their authors in such a way that the unaware reader is mislead to believe
that a particular method is <em>the</em> PLS method. This is probably one of the main
sources of confusion around the PLS literature. There is not such thing as
<em>the PLS algorithm</em>, instead there are the PLS algorithms (in plural). For
example, there is the PLS regression algorithm, the PLS path modeling algorithm,
the PLS algorithm for Principal Components Analysis (a.k.a. NIPALS-PCA), or the
PLS algorithm for Canonical Correlation Analysis (a.k.a. NIPALS-CCA), to mention
but a few.</p>
<p>If there is anything in common among Partial Least Squares methods is that they
all have an associated algorithm with a fairly uniform format. PLS methods
proceed in a less intuitive way compared to classical statistical procedures
where an optimization criteria is solved algebraically. PLS approaches are not
formulated in terms of a global criterion to be optmized. That is, PLS procedures
are stated without any maximization or minimization criterion. Just the data
decompositions and the system of regression equations are declared. Usually,
we express a model (in PLS mindset) in such a way that we identify the components,
and the equations between components. Instead of looking to derive an analytical
solution, we walk through the solution via a series of repetitive sequential
steps until reaching a good stable approximation. In other words, Partial Least
Squares are pure algorithmic approaches that consists of a series of steps
approximating a stable solution. In many cases, the PLS algorithms coincide
with standard algebraic solutions—usually involving an eigendecomposition.</p>
</div>
<div id="fragmentation" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.4</span> Fragmentation</h3>
<p>Another problematic issue is that PLS methods are usually presented in a
fragmented way. Most book chapters, papers, courses, workshops, and even
conferences deal with only a subset of the dozens of methods, rarely covering
a panoramic view. The main reasons for this compartmentalization has to do with
historical issues, and the way PLS methods have evolved. Furthermore,
accessability to the original references is largely difficult to most
practitioners and users.</p>
<p>The initial versions of PLS methods are documented in the 1960s works of Herman
Wold, and there is no controversy about the PLS origins. Throughout the entire
body of references and publications over several decades about PLS methods in
general, all authors acknowledge the roots of the so-called NIPALS procedures in
<span class="citation">H. Wold (<a href="#ref-Wold1966a" role="doc-biblioref">1966</a><a href="#ref-Wold1966a" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">H. Wold (<a href="#ref-Wold1966b" role="doc-biblioref">1966</a><a href="#ref-Wold1966b" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>, and <span class="citation">Lyttkens and Wold (<a href="#ref-WoldLyttkens1969" role="doc-biblioref">1969</a>)</span>. However, the place PLS methods
occupy in contemporary multivariate statitics is a bit more complicated.
PLS’s rising global popularity has led to disagreements about what constitutes
an authentic PLS algorithm. The same name is used to refer to different things,
while at the same time different terms are used for naming the same concept.
Even within PLS community, ideas about what PLS is varies and has caused debate
and tension every once in a while.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-two-wolds" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.5</span> The two Wolds</h3>
<p>Another source of confusion is the fact that two of the main leading authors
behind PLS methods share the same last name “Wold”. The unaware reader may think
that Wold is one single author without realizing that it can be either Herman
(the father) or Svante (the son). In fact, the way and style in which the two
Wolds presented their works have left a profound footprint in their ulterior
developments. The framework of Herman, emerged from econometric’s systems of
equations with latent variables, seems to have insurmountable disparities with
Svante’s Regression Models stemmed from chemometrics. Both branches, with its
various subdivisions, show contrasting differences at various levels, notably
at the area of application, but also at a philosophical, ideological, conceptual,
language, technical, spread and diffusion levels. Albeit their common mathematical
and operational elements, and even their shared genes, the contrasting physical
appearance between both frameworks puts an illusory divide between them that
can easily mislead all inexperienced users, and even some well versed PLS
<em>connoiseurs</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="pedagogy-of-pls" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.6</span> Pedagogy of PLS</h3>
<p>Another hurdle for studying PLS methods has to do with the fact that they have
evolved on top of existing techniques, which produces some pedagogical side-effects.
Why? Because if you want to learn about a specific PLS technique, usually you
must go through a double learning process. Consider for instance Principal
Components Analysis (PCA), and its corresponding PLS version NIPALS-PCA. If you
want to study NIPALS-PCA, you would begin studying PCA, and then switch to the
NIPALS-PCA algorithm. In general, you must first learn about the general
problem—and its standard solution—, be it regression, discrimination,
principal components, or canonical correlation, just to mention some of them.
And then you have to learn how to look at a given technique from the PLS angle.
Consequently, this adds an extra layer of concepts, terms, and jargon that you
have to deal with: one from the standard approach, and the other one from the
PLS approach. No wonder why PLS methods, despite their practical usefulness and
methodological attractiveness, have no reserved seats in undergraduate syllabus,
and have limited attention in postgraduate programs.</p>
</div>
<div id="current-status" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.7</span> Current Status</h3>
<p>Today Partial Least Squares methods are well recognized in pretty much all
fields of knowledge where they have been applied. There’s a tradition of biannual
symposiums exclusively dedicated to discuss advancements and state-of-the-art
around PLS and related methods. We also have special publications such as the
<em>Handbook of Partial Least Squares</em> <span class="citation">(Esposito-Vinzi et al. <a href="#ref-Espositoetal2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>,
<em>New Perspectives in Partial Least Squares and Related Methods</em> <span class="citation">(Abdi et al. <a href="#ref-Abdietal2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>.
On the computational side a wide range of software programs are available both
commercially and free. The largest group of tools is the dozen of R packages freely
available in <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>; there are also XLSTAT plug-ins
(by Addinsoft) for MS Excel; SmartPLS <span class="citation">(Ringle, Wende, and Will <a href="#ref-Ringleetal2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>, ADANCO, SIMCA
(by Umetrics), procedures for SAS, and libraries for Matlab, and Python. Also
important is the amazing amount of online learning resources with tutorials,
slides, videos, seminars, webinars, workshops, and specialized courses. All
this ecosystem reflects the success of PLS methods in industry, academia,
research, and governmental spheres.</p>
<p>But it hasn’t always been like this.</p>
