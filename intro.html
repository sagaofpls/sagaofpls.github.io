<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>A saga is a story of heroic events and achievements of a personage or family,
typically written in medieval Icelandic or Old Norse in the form of a prose
narrative. According to Wikipedia, the term saga originates from the Norse
“saga” and refers to “what is said” or “story, tale, history.” The closest term
in English to the word saga is “saw” (as in <em>old saying</em>). In this regard, I’m
using the word Saga to play with its meaning, and convey the ideas of history,
story, and narrative of events associated to Partial Least Squares methods.</p>
<p>The main motivating trigger behind this book has been my long standing obsession
to understand the historical development of Partial Least Squares methods in
order to find the who’s, why’s, what’s, when’s, and how’s. It is the result of
an intermittent 10 year quest, tracking bits and pieces of information in order
to assemble the story of such methods. Moreover, this text is my third iteration
on the subject, following two of my previous works: chapter 2 <em>“Historical Review”</em>
of my PhD thesis <span class="citation">(Sanchez <a href="#ref-Sanchez2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>, and the appendix
<em>“A Historical Overview of PLS-PM”</em> from my book <em>PLS Path Modeling with R</em>
<span class="citation">(Sanchez <a href="#ref-Sanchez2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This is NOT a technical book. It doesn’t cover theory, methodological aspects,
nor technical details of how the various PLS methods work (no discussions about
algebra, computational steps, interpretation issues, etc.). This is also not a
book written with a particular reader in mind. Instead, I’ve written its content
to organize the vast material I’ve collected so far, which includes not only
information from papers, chapters, proceedings, and books, but also thoughts,
memories, analysis, interpretations, and personal opinions. Having said that,
I imagine that this book can be used as a <strong>companion reading</strong> for any course,
workshop, or seminar about PLS methods, expecting to be enjoyed by anyone
interested on this topic. Regardless of whether you’re just taking your first
steps on the PLS arena, or you’ve already traveled a long way around PLS
territory, I’m sure you’ll find some value in the content of this work.</p>
<p>By writing this book, my aim is to shed some light about the teaching and
understanding of the historical background surrounding Partial Least Squares
methods. I’m convinced that this material will provide a fresh perspective and
create awareness, debunk myths, and clarify misunderstandings. I’m not the one
to judge whether the story of PLS has elements of an heroic tale. But I can tell
you for sure that this story is formed with a long and complicated series of
events, having scandinavian authors as protagonists. Hence the meaning of the
title “The Saga of PLS.”</p>

<div id="the-proof-of-the-pudding" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> The proof of the pudding</h2>
<p>In his classic <em>“Soft Modeling: The Basic Design and Some Extensions,”</em> Herman<br />
Wold includes the following footnote on page 24 <span class="citation">(H. Wold <a href="#ref-Wold1982b" role="doc-biblioref">1982</a><a href="#ref-Wold1982b" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Most nonlinear iterative techniques of estimation are lacking an analytic
proof of convergence. The proof of the pudding is in the eating.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Referring to the lack of a proof of convergence for his algorithm—when applied
to the general case of multiple relations among multiple sets of variables—,
Wold turned to the old saying of the <strong>proof of the pudding</strong> to invite readers
to try for themselves his methodology. Michel Tenenhaus (pronounced <em>Tenen-os</em>),
a French statistician and world renowned PLS expert, has also used the same
famous saying when presenting Partial Least Squares methods to new audiences.
For many years, Michel has included William Camden’s (1623) version “All the
proofs of a pudding are in the eating, not in the cooking,” in the last slide
of most of his presentations about PLS, inviting users to <em>taste</em> the method
and experience for themselves whether they like it or not.</p>
<p>For almost three decades, the convergence of Herman’s main algorithm was an
unresolved issue. This was due in part to the various options in which the
algorithm can be specified. Depending on the input settings, computations
converge most of the times. But there are a few exceptions. Today, we have a
much better understanding of the mechanics of the algorithm, and it is possible
to prove the convergence under certain circumstances. Unlike Wold, we also have
a better comprehension of how the steps operate, and we can even tweak the
algorithm in a such a way that we are certain of what’s going on inside of it.
Thanks to these advancements, a couple of years ago, Tenenhaus slightly modified
the pudding phrase to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the proofs of a pudding are in the eating… but it will taste even better
if you know the cooking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He’s right. Let me add to it that it doesn’t hurt to know about the story and
history behind the recipes, their chefs, their cooking styles, and their tasting
preferences. If anything, it will make your tasting of the pudding irresistible.</p>

<div id="outline" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Outline</h2>
<p>This book is organized into three major sections:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Introductory Review (chapters 2 - 4)</li>
<li>Historical Narrative (chapters 5 - 9)</li>
<li>Assessment and Conclusions (chapters 10 - 11)</li>
</ol>
<p>Part 1 covers a general introduction describing general aspects about Partial
Least Squares methods. Part 2 presents a historical narrative focused on Herman
Wold and the series of events that led him to develop the so-called
<em>PLS Soft Modeling</em> framework. It also contains a narrative of the role played
by Svante Wold and the development of PLS Regression. Instead of merely listing
various events and polluting the text with dozens of citations, I’ve preferred
to use a more fluid narrative style. Finally, the third part provides remarks
and critical assessments of several points often ignored in the PLS related
literature. My purpose is to give you a different perspective of Partial Least
Squares that, hopefully, will help you gain insight into a better understanding
and comprehension on the subject.</p>

<div id="acknowledgements" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>I’ve been able to gather invaluable unpublished information and details from my
own involvement around the PLS community, as well as from personal communications
with leading <em>PLSers</em> (via email, skype, and personal meetings).</p>
<p>My heartfelt thanks to Michel Tenenhaus, Wynne Chin, and Vincenzo Esposito-Vinzi.
They all have being very gentle to answer to my emails full of questions and
inquiries, providing responses full of details and milimetric precision.</p>
<p>Also many thanks to Christian Ringle, José Luis Roldán, and Aida Eslami for
their emails with useful information and enriching comments. Likewise, I would
like to thank the various friends, colleagues, and, for the lack of a better
term, <em>followers</em> around the world that have been helping me proof-read the
content, detecting bugs, and fixing typos. I take full responsibility for any
prevailing errata in the text.</p>
<p>Last but not least, you wouldn’t be reading this book if it wasn’t for the
patience and support of my loving wife Jessica. Not only she was willing once
again to be my household editor, but she never complained my occupying of the
dining table, and taking over the living room as my personal workspace. If you
find any value from the content in this book, which I am sure you will, you owe
her almost as much as you owe me.</p>
