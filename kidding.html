<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> You’ve got to be kidding me</h1>
<p>The first time I heard about PLS was in October 2004 when I first met professor
Tomàs Aluja—my former PhD adviser. I had just recently moved to Barcelona to
start my graduate studies in statistics, and I had been designated Tomàs’s new
mentee. At the end of our first meeting when I was about to leave his office,
Tomàs asked me a seemingly intrascendental question: “Have you ever heard about
PLS?”</p>
<p>“P. L. S.?”</p>
<p>I repeated those letters to myself without pronouncing any words. Fearing to
give a bad impression to my brand new mentor, I quickly scanned the hard-disk
of my brain in search for any hint. Unsuccessfully struggling to find any answer,
I ended up with a perfect clueless expression in my face.</p>
<p>I had no idea what PLS was or what it meant.</p>
<p>The reason why Tomàs asked me about PLS was because he was in charge of organizing
<em>PLS’05 - The 4th International Symposium on Partial Least Squares and Related Methods</em>
for the following year (September, 2005). He wanted to know if I would be willing
to help him with some of the organizational details for the symposium. Little
did I know the tremendous impact those three mysterious letters would have in
the coming years of my analytics career.</p>
<p>I became involved with PLS in a very unintended way. One of my first duties as
part of the <em>PLS’05</em> staff, was being in charge of receiving the abstracts and
paper submissions for the symposium, making sure they complied with the strict
guidelines-for-authors. I spent my time sending emails and pestering authors
kindly requesting them to fix the page layout, change the font size, reduce the
number of pages, and things like that. One of the orders Tomàs gave me was to
read all the papers. Grudgingly, I followed his command and sucked it all up.
However, <em>reading</em> doesn’t necessarily mean <em>understanding</em>. From all the
submitted papers, I was able to understand three of them… at the most. And
even then my understanding was very superficial. The common thing about those
papers was their very applied and digestable examples that prevented me from
getting lost with all the unintelligible details. By the way, this is NOT how
anyone should ever try to learn about PLS methods.</p>
<p>I had a more formal and intensive introduction to the PLS framework with Tomàs’s
course “Advanced Methods for Multivariate Data Analysis.” The outline of the
course was based on the great book <em>La Régression PLS: Théorie et Pratique</em> by
Michel <span class="citation">(Tenenhaus <a href="#ref-Tenenhaus1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span>. The book is a marvelous piece, with Michel’s unique
eloquent writing style, explaining things in a very detailed way, using a clear notation, and full of examples and graphics. I guess everything would have been
fine if it wasn’t for the fact that I had a very limited knowledge of French.
Which it only makes it harder when you’re not only a PLS novice but also a
French-language beginner. Luckily, <em>google translate</em> was already available at
that time, providing a considerable help in deciphering some of the book’s content.</p>
<p>Tomàs’s class was a very hands-on course. Each student was responsible of studying
a chapter from the book, programming the corresponding method in R, and giving a
lecture to the rest of the class. I got to present chapter 8—PLS Regression
for one response variable. Tomàs kept for himself the presentation of the PLS
Path Modeling (PLS-PM) approach for the last lecture. That day he introduced the
technique with an example using the famous Russett dataset, and then he proceeded
to talk about how the method worked. When he got to the description of the PLS-PM
algorithm, however, I was having a hard time understanding all the steps. The
worst part was my fruitless attempt trying to connect the PLS regression algorithms
with the PLS-PM algorithm. The question that was driving me crazy was: Where on
earth were the PLS regressions in the PLS-PM algorithm? I raised my hand and
asked Tomàs if he could please show the rest of the class where the PLS
regressions were. To my surprise, his answer was even more disconcerting:
“Regressions? What regressions? This has nothing to do with PLS Regression.
This is PLS Path Modeling.” I’m pretty sure Tomàs does not even remember these
details. But they definitely had a profound impact on me.</p>
<p>All I remember thinking was something like: “You’ve got to be kidding me, this
PLS stuff makes no sense whatsoever!” I was definitely biting off more than I
was able to chew.</p>
<p>I won’t lie to you. My introduction to the PLS world was not a smooth one.
Besides my very limited knowledge of French, another difficulty was my equally
limited knowledge of the techniques in Michel’s book like Canonical Correlation
Analysis, Redundancy Analysis, and Inter-Battery Factor Analysis. One of the
morals from this experience was that I needed to learn French; the other moral
was that this was also not the best way to start learning about PLS from scratch.</p>
<p>I felt so confused and disoriented, but eventually I managed to my find way out
through the PLS labyrinth over the following years. My biggest consolation, to
my suprise, was when I heard Michel Tenenhaus story in front of the audience at
one of the PLS Research Workshops in Paris, 2009. He told us about his PLS tale:
having started studying PLS regression, he was later referred to PLS Path Modeling,
only to find out that, initially, nothing made sense to him. I was so relieved
in knowing that I was not the only one with the same big confussion. Even a PLS
<em>jedi master</em> like Michel had faced the same puzzle I had struggled with.</p>
<p>I became obsessed with the story behind PLS since the very first moment I started
to work on my PhD dissertation about PLS Path Modeling. As a grad student in the
fall of 2005, I remember googling about “Partial Least Squares” and getting links
back that talked about PLS Regression. When I tried to be more specific and
searched for “Partial Least Squares Path Modeling,” there was nothing but again
PLS Regression retrieved results only. Why was there almost nothing about PLS
Path Modeling? There were virtually no resources about the original works by
Herman Wold, or the so-called Structural Equation Models via PLS approach.
Moreover, most of the available resources on the Web were basically
chemometrics-related material. It is amazing to see how much things have changed
in just a decade. But it hasn’t been easy. It has required a titanic effort
coordinating the work of a large number of scholars. Gradually, the barriers have
been pushed in order to revive a methodological framework that was heading toward
the annals of statistical methods that sadly end up in the dead archives of
university libraries.</p>
<p>One of the very first things I knew I wanted to do was to find out more about
the history of PLS methods. The main resource I had in my hands was a tutorial
on PLS Path Modeling, which was basically a draft for the famous article
<em>“PLS Path Modeling”</em> <span class="citation">(Tenenhaus et al. <a href="#ref-Tenenhausetal2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>. I started tracking the references
listed in the tutorial, and I was happy to find that the Economics and Math
libraries of the University of Barcelona had copies of the two volumes
<em>Systems under indirect observation: Causality, structure, prediction</em>
<span class="citation">(H. Wold <a href="#ref-Wold1982b" role="doc-biblioref">1982</a><a href="#ref-Wold1982b" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span>, the intimidating treatise
<em>Latent Variable Path Modeling with Partial Least Squares</em> <span class="citation">(Lohmöller <a href="#ref-Lohmoller1989" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span>,
the <em>Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences</em> with the entry of PLS <span class="citation">(Wold <a href="#ref-Wold1985a" role="doc-biblioref">1985</a>)</span>,
and <em>The Making of Statisticians</em> containing the autobiographical essay of
Herman <span class="citation">(H. Wold <a href="#ref-Wold1982a" role="doc-biblioref">1982</a><a href="#ref-Wold1982a" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>. Little by little I started to dig out and uncover
fragments of a fascinating story.</p>
<p>All I wanted was to be able to answer the <em>who</em>, <em>when</em>, <em>how</em>, and <em>why</em>. Who
created PLS? When was it developed? How was the development process? And why?
How does something such as PLS is developed? What were the circumstances that
gave birth to that framework? In this sense, the quest became a quest not only
about PLS itself but also about its creator, about his mind, his ideas, and
surrounding context. Among all my inquires, one question has remained for years
in the back burner of my head: Why was PLS Path Modeling not that well known?
Think about it. By 2005, the first works about PLS had already been present for
almost 30 years! Yet, having access to those references was—and still is—ridiculously difficult. I think I have now most of the elements to answer
the questions that have been lingering since that fall of 2005.</p>
